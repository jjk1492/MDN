    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <!-- Recipe description. This is its own section so wrap it in a paragraph tag. -->
    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

    <!-- Hummus description. Seperate from the recipe description, so give the section its own paragraph tag. -->
    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <!-- Second level heading, marks the next 'area' of the page. Using h2 increases readability and SEO. --->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <!-- List of ingredients, it doesn't matter what order ingredients are collected in so an unordered list is used. -->
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Next 'area' of the page. Use an h2 tag to make it distinguishable. -->
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <!-- A recipe should followed in specific steps, therefore use an ordered list this time around. -->
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <!-- These elements aren't another step, just a description of the step above, using a nested ul makes this clearer to the user. -->
        <ul>
            <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
            <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <!-- Suggested modifications that can be made to the recipe. This is a new section so give it it's own paragraph tag. -->
    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <!-- Next 'area' of the page. Use a second level head so it's easily distinguishable to users. -->
    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <!-- Description of how recipe should be stored. New section so it gets its own paragraph tag. -->
    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <!-- This is a tip about storage so give it's own paragraph tag. This isn't critical for the recipe, but is important to using an em tag emphasizes it but makes it clear it's a suggestion. -->
    <p><em>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</em></p>
